# Understanding Your Command Structure in Tauri

Let me clarify the structure issues and recommend a better approach:

## The Problem: Duplicated Module Names

You've identified the key issue: both `main.rs` and `lib.rs` have their own `commands.rs` module. This is creating confusion and circular dependencies.

## Understanding the Current Structure

1. **Duplicate Module Names**: 
   - Binary crate (main.rs) has `mod commands;`
   - Library crate (lib.rs) has `pub mod commands;`
   - This creates ambiguity about which `commands` module to use

2. **Scattered Command Files**:
   - You have multiple *_commands.rs files (part_commands.rs, workspace_commands.rs, etc.)
   - commands.rs itself doesn't contain much

## Best Practice: Move ALL Commands to Library Crate

For a Tauri application, the recommended approach is:

1. **Keep ALL command implementations in the library crate**
   - Commands are core functionality that should live in the library
   - This avoids circular dependencies

2. **Organize commands into logical submodules**:
   ```
   src/
   ├── lib.rs
   ├── commands/
   │   ├── mod.rs          # Re-exports all commands
   │   ├── parts.rs        # Part-related commands
   │   ├── workspace.rs    # Workspace commands
   │   └── repository.rs   # Repository commands
   ```

3. **Binary crate should only register commands**:
   ```rust
   // main.rs
   fn main() {
       tauri::Builder::default()
           .invoke_handler(tauri::generate_handler![
               // Import from library crate
               implexa::commands::parts::do_something,
               implexa::commands::workspace::list_workspaces,
               // etc.
           ])
           .run(tauri::generate_context!())
           .expect("error running app");
   }
   ```

## Should You Merge commands.rs Into Other Files?

Yes! It appears your `commands.rs` doesn't have much content, so you should:

1. Move any functionality from binary crate's `commands.rs` into appropriate library modules
2. Organize commands into logical groups in the library crate
3. Use a `commands/mod.rs` file to re-export all commands if needed

This resolves the circular dependency by ensuring the dependency only flows one way: binary crate → library crate.

## Implementation Plan

1. Move ALL command implementations to the library crate
2. Remove the commands module from the binary crate
3. Import commands from the library in your main.rs
4. Group related commands together for better organization
