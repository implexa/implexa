## Current Task

Implementing the crate structure refactoring described in `crate-structure-refactor.md`.

## Progress

The refactoring has been successfully implemented with the following changes:

1. Created a modular structure for all command modules:
   - Created `src/commands/mod.rs` as a central module that re-exports all command submodules
   - Created individual modules for each command category (repository, parts, workspace, etc.)
   - Moved command functions to their respective modules

2. Fixed implementation details in various modules:
   - Fixed `PartManager` initialization in parts.rs to use references correctly
   - Fixed SQLite result conversion in revision.rs
   - Removed unused mutable variables

3. Updated lib.rs to export the commands module with proper structure

4. Simplified main.rs to use only essential commands for now

## Next Steps

1. Update the Tauri command registration to properly register all commands from the library crate
2. Add the `#[tauri::command]` attribute to all command functions in the library modules
=======

## Recent Fixes

1. Fixed missing `WorkflowManager` import in part_management.rs
2. Fixed in-memory database journal mode issue in connection_manager.rs
   - In-memory SQLite databases use "MEMORY" journal mode, not "WAL"
   - Updated tests to expect "MEMORY" journal mode for in-memory databases
3. Fixed syntax error in connection_manager.rs (removed extra closing brace)
4. Cleaned up all compiler warnings throughout the codebase:
   - Added `#[allow(unused_imports)]` to main.rs to handle planned imports
   - Added `#[allow(dead_code)]` to GitBackendManager.log_operation, which is reserved for future logging
   - Fixed unused field warnings in various Git backend manager structs with `#[allow(dead_code)]`
   - Fixed unused imports in workspace.rs and workflow.rs
   - Renamed unused variables with underscore prefix (_variable_name) to indicate intentional non-use

## Notes

- The code now compiles successfully and all 35 tests are passing with no warnings in the main application code
- Some Tauri command registration adjustments may be needed for the full refactoring
- The basic structure is in place, but more work is needed to fully integrate with Tauri's command system
- Code is now cleaner and follows better Rust practices by handling unused code patterns appropriately
