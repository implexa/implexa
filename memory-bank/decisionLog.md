- **Context:** The project needed a structured way to maintain architectural documentation, track progress, and record decisions.
- **Decision:** Initialize a Memory Bank with core files (productContext.md, activeContext.md, progress.md, decisionLog.md).
- **Alternatives:**
  - Traditional documentation in /doc directory: Less structured and harder to maintain
  - Wiki-based documentation: Requires additional infrastructure
  - No formal documentation structure: Leads to scattered and inconsistent documentation
- **Consequences:**
  - Positive: Provides a structured approach to documentation, centralizes project context, facilitates knowledge sharing
  - Negative: Requires discipline to maintain and update

### DEC-004 - Git Backend Manager Architecture
- **Date:** 2025-03-02
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** The Git Backend Manager is a core component of Implexa that handles all interactions with Git repositories. A well-designed architecture was needed to ensure modularity, testability, and integration with other components.
- **Decision:** Implement a modular architecture with six subcomponents (Repository Manager, Operation Handler, LFS Manager, Hook Manager, Conflict Resolver, Auth Provider) and clearly defined interfaces.
- **Alternatives:**
  - Monolithic design: Simpler but less maintainable and testable
  - Thin wrapper around git2-rs: Less abstraction but more direct access to Git functionality
  - Process-based approach (shell out to git CLI): More familiar to developers but less performant and secure
- **Consequences:**
  - Positive: Clear separation of concerns, improved testability, better error handling, and more maintainable code
  - Positive: Abstractions that align with PLM concepts rather than raw Git operations
  - Positive: Strong typing and comprehensive error handling through Rust's type system
  - Negative: More complex initial implementation compared to simpler approaches
  - Negative: Potential overhead from additional abstraction layers

### DEC-005 - SQLite Database Schema Design
- **Date:** 2025-03-02
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** The project needed a database schema to store metadata for parts, relationships, and properties. The schema needed to be flexible enough to support various types of metadata while maintaining data integrity.
- **Decision:** Implement a comprehensive SQLite database schema with tables for Parts, Revisions, Relationships, Properties, Manufacturer Parts, Approvals, Files, Workflows, Workflow States, and Workflow Transitions.
- **Alternatives:**
  - NoSQL database: More flexible but less structured and potentially less reliable for relational data
  - File-based metadata: Simpler but less powerful for querying and maintaining relationships
  - Embedded metadata in Git: More integrated with version control but limited query capabilities
  - PostgreSQL or other client-server database: More powerful but adds deployment complexity
- **Consequences:**
  - Positive: Strong data integrity through foreign key constraints and transactions
  - Positive: Flexible metadata through key-value properties with typed values
  - Positive: Support for complex workflows through configurable states and transitions
  - Positive: Integration with Git through commit hash references
  - Positive: SQLite's embedded nature aligns well with Tauri's architecture
  - Negative: Potential performance limitations with very large datasets
  - Negative: Limited concurrent write access compared to client-server databases

### DEC-006 - Part Management Workflow Design
- **Date:** 2025-03-02
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** The project needed a workflow for managing parts through their lifecycle, from creation to obsolescence. The workflow needed to be simple enough for small teams while supporting parallel development of multiple parts.
- **Decision:** Implement a simplified workflow with states (Draft, In Review, Released, Revision, Obsolete) and a Git-like review process, with support for multiple parts in draft state through separate workspaces.
- **Alternatives:**
  - Complex approval workflow: More control but excessive for small teams
  - Simple state machine: Easier to implement but less flexible
  - External workflow engine: More powerful but adds complexity
  - No formal workflow: Maximum flexibility but lacks traceability and consistency
- **Consequences:**
  - Positive: Simple and familiar workflow similar to Git merge/pull requests
  - Positive: Support for parallel development of multiple parts
  - Positive: Clear integration with Git branch strategy
  - Positive: Simplified roles appropriate for small teams
  - Positive: Workspace management for CAD integration
  - Negative: May need enhancement for larger teams with more complex approval needs
  - Negative: Multiple workspaces add complexity to the implementation

### DEC-007 - User Interface Architecture
- **Date:** 2025-03-02
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** The project needed a user interface architecture that would provide a modern, responsive, and intuitive interface for managing hardware product lifecycle data, while integrating with the Tauri/Rust backend.
- **Decision:** Implement a layered UI architecture using React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS, with React Context API for state management and Tauri Commands API for backend integration.
- **Alternatives:**
  - Vue.js: Another popular frontend framework but less TypeScript integration
  - Angular: More opinionated and feature-rich but steeper learning curve
  - Redux for state management: More powerful but adds complexity
  - MobX for state management: Simpler than Redux but less explicit
  - CSS frameworks other than TailwindCSS: Less utility-focused and potentially more bloated
- **Consequences:**
  - Positive: Strong typing with TypeScript improves code quality and developer experience
  - Positive: Component-based architecture with React promotes reusability and maintainability
  - Positive: Context API provides simpler state management for a small to medium-sized application
  - Positive: TailwindCSS enables rapid UI development with consistent styling
  - Positive: Tauri Commands API provides a clean interface to the Rust backend
  - Negative: React's frequent updates may require ongoing maintenance
  - Negative: Context API may not scale as well as Redux for very complex state management
  - Negative: TailwindCSS can lead to verbose class names in components
