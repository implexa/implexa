# Git-Based PLM/PDM Solution: Phase 1 Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure) of the Git-based PLM/PDM solution. The goal of Phase 1 is to establish the core components that will form the foundation of the system, including Git integration, metadata storage, part creation, and basic UI.

## Components Developed

We have developed the following core components:

1. **Git Backend Manager** (`GitBackendManager.ts`)
   - Handles repository initialization, cloning, and Git operations
   - Manages Git-LFS for binary files
   - Sets up Git hooks for workflow automation

2. **SQLite Database Schema** (`schema.sql`)
   - Defines tables for parts, revisions, relationships, properties, etc.
   - Includes views for common queries
   - Creates triggers for status changes

3. **Part Manager** (`PartManager.ts`)
   - Handles part creation with proper part numbers
   - Manages part status transitions
   - Manages revisions and metadata

4. **Part Directory Manager** (`PartDirectoryManager.ts`)
   - Manages the unified directory structure
   - Handles file operations within part directories
   - Lists and filters parts based on categories

5. **UI Components**
   - Create Part Form for manual metadata entry
   - Electron application with main process and preload script

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Project Setup (Week 1)

  - [x] Define tables for parts, revisions, relationships, etc.
  - [x] Create views for common queries
  - [x] Set up triggers for status changes

- [x] Implement Part Manager
  - [x] Part creation with proper part numbers
  - [x] Status workflow management
  - [x] Revision management

- [x] Implement Part Directory Manager
  - [x] Unified directory structure
  - [x] File operations
  - [x] Part listing and filtering

### 3. User Interface (Weeks 3-4)

- [ ] Design and implement basic UI components
  - [x] Create Part Form

  - [ ] User guide for basic operations

- [ ] Create developer documentation
  - [ ] Architecture overview
  - [ ] API documentation

- [ ] Polish UI and fix bugs
  - [ ] Improve error messages
  - [ ] Add loading indicators
  - [ ] Fix any usability issues

## Next Steps for Phase 2

After completing Phase 1, we'll move on to Phase 2 (BOM Management & KiCad Integration) with the following focus areas:

1. **KiCad Database Integration**
   - Direct SQLite integration
   - ODBC configuration
   - Database version control

2. **BOM Management**
   - KiCad BOM extraction
   - CSV/Excel BOM importers
   - Relationship tracking between parts

3. **Diff Tools**
   - Specialized diff tools for KiCad files
   - SQLite database diffing

## Development Environment Setup

To set up the development environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]
cd git-plm-pdm

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development mode
npm run start:dev
```

## Building the Application

To build the application for distribution:

```bash
# Build for current platform
npm run build

# Package for distribution
npm run dist
```

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual services and functions
2. **Integration Tests**: Test interaction between components
3. **UI Tests**: Test UI components and user workflows
4. **Manual Testing**: Verify core functionality manually

## Deliverables for Phase 1

1. A functional Electron application with:
   - Repository initialization and cloning
   - Part creation with proper part numbering
   - Status workflow management
   - Revision management
   - Manual metadata entry interface
   - Basic file management

2. Documentation:
   - User guide
   - Developer documentation
   - Architecture overview

## Conclusion

Phase 1 establishes the core infrastructure for the Git-based PLM/PDM solution. By completing these tasks, we'll have a solid foundation to build upon in subsequent phases, eventually leading to a full-featured system that bridges the gap between software engineering practices and hardware design workflows.
