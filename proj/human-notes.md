- Should we use GUIDs for most of the sql IDs? (except part number)?
- might need to edit the default git gnore lists in git-backedn/operation/mod.rs
- Do the db updates need to be done in the pre commit hooks? If you do it i nthe post commit will it not be commited? Or are there two commits, one for the changes and one for the metadata?
