## Implementation Summary

The thread safety solution for SQLite connection management has been successfully implemented using Approach 3 from the [SQLite Thread Safety Approaches](./sqlite-thread-safety-approaches.md) document: Single Connection with Synchronous Mutex.

### Key Changes

1. **Mutex-Protected Connection**: Replaced `RefCell<Connection>` with `Arc<Mutex<Connection>>` in the ConnectionManager
2. **WAL Mode**: Enabled SQLite's Write-Ahead Logging mode for improved concurrency
3. **Clone Support**: Added Clone trait implementation for ConnectionManager
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained the existing ConnectionManager API to minimize codebase changes
5. **Error Handling**: Updated error handling to properly handle mutex lock failures
6. **Part Display Function**: Updated Part's display_part_number method to work with the new ConnectionManager

### Implementation Details

```rust
use std::path::Path;
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use rusqlite::{Connection, Transaction};

#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct ConnectionManager {
    connection: Arc<Mutex<Connection>>,
}

impl ConnectionManager {
    pub fn new(db_path: &Path) -> Result<Self, rusqlite::Error> {
        let connection = Connection::open(db_path)?;
        
        // Enable WAL mode for better concurrency
        connection.execute_batch("PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL")?;
        
        Ok(Self {
            connection: Arc::new(Mutex::new(connection)),
        })
    }
    
    // ... execute, execute_mut, and transaction methods ...
}
```

### Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests that verify:
- WAL mode is correctly enabled
- Thread safety is properly implemented with the Arc<Mutex<>> pattern
- Basic operations work correctly with the new implementation
- Connection cloning works as expected

### Design Principles Followed

- **KISS**: Used the simplest solution that meets the requirements (single mutex-protected connection)
- **YAGNI**: Avoided over-engineered solutions like complex connection pools
- **SOLID**: Maintained the same interface while improving the implementation
- **DRY**: Reused existing patterns for error handling and connection management

### Status

- Implementation complete
- Library builds successfully (`cargo build --lib`)
- Updated [activeContext.md](./activeContext.md) to reflect the completed implementation
- Updated DEC-021 in [decisionLog.md](./decisionLog.md) from "Proposed" to "Implemented"

### Remaining Issues

There are some remaining issues in the `part_commands.rs` file and other command files that require updates to match the latest database schema and API changes. These issues are independent of the thread safety implementation itself and should be addressed separately.
