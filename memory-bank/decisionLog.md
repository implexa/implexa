## Decisions

### DEC-010 - Rust Module Organization Pattern
- **Date:** 2025-03-03
- **Status:** Implemented
- **Context:** The project currently uses the mod.rs pattern for organizing Rust modules (e.g., src/git_backend/conflict/mod.rs). There was a discussion about potentially switching to the newer filename-as-module pattern (e.g., src/git_backend/conflict.rs) while the project is still young.
- **Decision:** Switch from the mod.rs pattern to the filename-as-module pattern for all Rust modules in the project.
- **Alternatives:**
  - **mod.rs pattern (current):**
    - Each module is a directory with a mod.rs file inside it
    - Example: src/git_backend/conflict/mod.rs
  - **filename-as-module pattern (newer):**
    - Each module is a file named after the module
    - Example: src/git_backend/conflict.rs
- **Consequences:**
  - **Positive:**
    - Flatter directory structure that's easier to navigate
    - Unique filenames make navigation and tab management easier in editors
    - Aligns with current Rust community best practices and style guide recommendations
    - Makes future refactoring easier (moving and renaming modules)
    - Improves developer experience, especially for those familiar with modern Rust codebases
  - **Negative:**
    - Requires a one-time refactoring effort to rename and move files
    - Less visual indication in file explorers that a directory is a module
    - May require more explicit pub mod declarations for submodules
- **References:** Rust style guide recommendations, project discussion, memory-bank/rust-module-refactoring-guide.md, src/git_backend.rs

- **Decision:** Implement an enhanced hybrid numbering approach combining category and subcategory codes with sequential numbers: `[Category]-[Subcategory]-[Sequential Number]`
- **Alternatives:**
  - Purely sequential numbers: Simple but not human-readable
  - Intelligent part numbers with encoded attributes: Human-readable but rigid and can become outdated
  - UUID-based identifiers: System-friendly but not human-readable
- **Consequences:**
  - Positive: Balances human readability with system flexibility, provides meaningful categorization, supports future growth
  - Negative: Requires maintenance of category and subcategory lists, potential for miscategorization
- **References:** PRD section "Part Numbering Strategy"

### DEC-003 - Memory Bank Initialization
- **Date:** 2025-03-02

### DEC-013 - Enhanced Part Numbering System
- **Date:** 2025-03-03
- **Status:** Implemented
- **Context:** The original part numbering system used string-based part IDs with embedded category and subcategory codes. This approach had limitations in flexibility and maintainability, particularly when categories needed to be updated.
- **Decision:** Implement an enhanced part numbering system with the following changes:
  - Use sequential integer IDs as primary keys in the database
  - Create separate Categories and Subcategories tables for user-configurable categories
  - Generate display part numbers dynamically using the format `[Category Code]-[Subcategory Code]-[Sequential Number]`
  - Start sequential numbers at 10000 to avoid leading zeros
- **Alternatives:**

  - Embed category information in part properties: More flexible but less structured
- **Consequences:**
  - Positive: Categories and subcategories can be updated without breaking references
  - Positive: User-configurable categories and subcategories provide more flexibility
  - Positive: Integer primary keys improve database performance for joins and indexes
  - Positive: Display part numbers maintain human readability while database uses efficient IDs

### DEC-015 - Directory Structure Implementation Approach
- **Date:** 2025-03-04
- **Status:** Proposed
- **Context:** Following the directory structure design (DEC-008), we needed to implement the configurable directory structure system for parts and libraries. This implementation needed to support minimal, standard, and extended templates while maintaining consistency and Git integration.
- **Decision:** Implement the directory structure system with the following approach:
  - Create a JSON schema for directory templates that defines directories, subdirectories, and files
  - Implement three standard templates (minimal, standard, extended) with different levels of complexity
  - Add support for custom templates in the config/directory-templates/custom/ directory
  - Create a directory creation function that generates part directories based on templates
  - Implement template selection in the UI for part creation
  - Store templates in the config/directory-templates/ directory of the PLM repository
- **Alternatives:**
  - Hard-coded directory structure: Simpler but less flexible and configurable

### DEC-019 - UI Command Interface Implementation
- **Date:** 2025-03-06
- **Status:** Implemented
- **Context:** The project had developed robust backend functionality in Rust for repository management, part management, workflow handling, approvals, manufacturer parts, properties, and files. However, this functionality needed to be exposed to the frontend React application through the Tauri commands API to make it accessible to the user interface.
- **Decision:** Implement a comprehensive set of Tauri command interfaces for all backend modules using a consistent pattern of state management and data transfer object (DTO) structures:
  1. Create separate command modules for each major backend functionality area
  2. Use strongly-typed DTOs for data exchange between frontend and backend
  3. Implement proper state management using Tauri's State API
  4. Use a consistent error handling approach across all command interfaces
  5. Structure commands to follow RESTful-like patterns when appropriate

- **Alternatives:**
  - **Monolithic command module:** Simpler file structure but less maintainable as the application grows
  - **Thinner commands with more frontend logic:** Less backend code but more duplication in the frontend
  - **GraphQL-style API:** More flexible querying but adds complexity
  - **Direct FFI calls:** More performant but less type-safe and harder to maintain

### DEC-016 - Debugging and Code Quality Improvements
- **Date:** 2025-03-04
- **Status:** Implemented
- **Context:** During the implementation of the unit testing framework, several code quality issues and bugs were identified that needed to be addressed to ensure the codebase was testable and reliable.
- **Decision:** Implement a series of fixes and improvements to address the identified issues:
  1. Fix syntax errors and missing implementations in key modules
  2. Update dependency management in Cargo.toml
  3. Improve error handling and type safety
  4. Fix mutable reference issues in database connections
  5. Ensure consistent API design across components

### DEC-018 - Database Connection Management Refactoring
- **Date:** 2025-03-04
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** During the implementation of unit tests, several issues were identified with the current database connection management approach:
  1. Multiple mutable borrows of the same connection in test code
  2. Type mismatches between `&Transaction` and `&mut Connection`
  3. Inconsistent mutability requirements across manager structs
  4. Difficulty in mocking database connections for testing
- **Decision:** Implement a `ConnectionManager` with interior mutability that provides controlled access to the database connection. This approach uses `RefCell` to manage mutable access to the connection and provides a consistent API for executing operations and managing transactions.
- **Alternatives:**
  - **Connection Pool Approach:** Implement a connection pool that provides connections on demand, avoiding multiple mutable borrows. Rejected as overly complex for our needs.
  - **Manager Factory Approach:** Create a factory that produces manager instances with their own connection. Rejected due to potential resource management issues.
  - **Transaction-Based Approach:** Redesign managers to accept transactions instead of connections. Partially incorporated into the chosen solution.
  - **Keep current approach but fix individual issues:** Simpler but doesn't address the root architectural issue.
  - **Complete rewrite of database layer:** More thorough but excessive for the issues identified.
  - **Use an ORM like Diesel:** Different approach that might avoid some issues but introduces new complexity.
  - **Separate read-only and read-write operations:** More complex API but clearer mutability requirements.
- **Consequences:**
  - Positive: Resolves multiple mutable borrow issues in tests through interior mutability
  - Positive: Provides clearer ownership and lifetime semantics
  - Positive: Improves testability through better isolation and easier mocking
  - Positive: More consistent API across manager structs

### DEC-020 - Dual Crate Structure Import Paths
- **Date:** 2025-03-06
- **Status:** Implemented
- **Context:** The Implexa project has a dual crate structure with a library crate (`lib.rs`) exporting core functionality and a binary crate (`main.rs`) implementing the Tauri application. Command files in the binary crate were incorrectly accessing functionality from the library crate using `crate::` imports instead of `implexa::` imports.
- **Decision:** Fix all import paths in command files by changing `crate::` imports to `implexa::` imports to properly reflect the architectural relationship between the binary crate and the library crate.
- **Alternatives:**
  - **Restructure as a single crate:** Would simplify imports but eliminate the benefits of the dual crate architecture
  - **Move all command files into the library crate:** Would avoid the issue but blur the boundary between library and application code
  - **Use re-exports in the binary crate:** Would avoid changing imports but add complexity and indirection
- **Consequences:**
  - **Positive:** Correctly reflects the architectural relationship between crates
  - **Positive:** Allows command files to properly access functionality from the library crate
  - **Positive:** Maintains the benefits of the dual crate structure (separation of concerns, code reuse, better testing, clear interfaces)
  - **Positive:** Makes the codebase more maintainable as it grows
  - **Negative:** Required changes to multiple files
  - **Negative:** May require similar vigilance for future command files
- **References:** dual-crate-structure-fix.md, src/commands.rs, src/part_commands.rs, src/relationship_commands.rs, src/revision_commands.rs, src/workflow_commands.rs, src/file_commands.rs, src/approval_commands.rs, src/manufacturer_part_commands.rs, src/property_commands.rs

### DEC-021 - Thread Safety in SQLite Connection Management
- **Date:** 2025-03-06
- **Status:** Implemented
- **Context:** A critical thread safety issue was discovered in our SQLite connection management approach. The `ConnectionManager` using `RwLock` for thread-safe interior mutability was insufficient because `rusqlite::Connection` itself internally uses `RefCell` for its connection and statement cache, making it incompatible with Tauri's requirement that state objects implement the `Send + Sync` traits for thread safety.
- **Decision:** Implement a single connection with a standard synchronous Mutex approach, which uses SQLite's Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) mode to improve concurrency for readers. This synchronous mutex-based approach is appropriate given the specific usage pattern of Implexa, where write access will only ever happen with a single user on a single computer and Git is the primary mechanism for sharing data between users.
- **Alternatives:**
  - **Connection Pool Approach:** Use r2d2 and r2d2_sqlite to create a pool of connections. Initially considered the best solution but determined to be overkill for the current usage pattern.
  - **Async Mutex Approach:** Protect a single connection with an async mutex from tokio. Would require rewriting to async/await paradigm across the codebase.
  - **Thread-Local Storage:** Use thread-local storage to maintain separate connections for each thread. Complicated lifecycle management and harder error handling.
  - **Maintain Current Approach:** Keep the current approach but limit database access to a single thread. Would severely limit application functionality.
- **Consequences:**
  - **Positive:** Simplest implementation that directly solves the thread safety issue
  - **Positive:** No async rewrite required, maintaining existing synchronous API
  - **Positive:** No additional dependencies beyond standard library
  - **Positive:** WAL mode provides improved concurrency for readers
  - **Positive:** Keeps existing ConnectionManager API with minimal changes
  - **Positive:** Aligns with application's single-user-per-instance usage pattern
  - **Negative:** Only one database operation can execute at a time (write operations)
  - **Negative:** Limited scalability if usage patterns change (e.g., multiple concurrent users)
  - **Negative:** Potential for blocking UI if operations take a long time
