  - Moved src/git_backend/operation/mod.rs to src/git_backend/operation.rs
  - Moved src/git_backend/repository/mod.rs to src/git_backend/repository.rs
  - Updated Cargo.toml to add tempfile as a dev-dependency for tests
  - Verified all tests pass with the new module structure
- Established comprehensive coding standards for Rust, TypeScript/JavaScript, and CSS

## Current Phase
Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure): Git backend, metadata storage, basic UI

## Key Insights
- The project uses Tauri and Rust for better performance and security compared to Electron
- KiCad integration is a priority for the initial CAD tool support
- Git-based version control is a core differentiator from other PLM/PDM solutions
- The part numbering system uses a hybrid approach:
  - Integer sequential IDs as primary keys in the database (starting at 10000)
  - User-configurable categories and subcategories stored in separate tables
  - Display part numbers generated dynamically in the format `[Category Code]-[Subcategory Code]-[Sequential Number]`
  - This approach allows categories to be updated without breaking references
- The Git Backend Manager needs a modular design with clear interfaces for testability
- Git-LFS is essential for handling binary files and large assets in hardware design
- The database schema needs to support flexible metadata through key-value properties
- Workflow states and transitions need to be configurable in the database
- Integration between Git commits and database revisions is critical for traceability
- The Part Management Workflow should be simple and similar to Git MRs/PRs
- Multiple parts in draft state need to be supported with separate workspaces
- The system is designed for small teams (1-2 people) with simple role-based permissions
- The UI architecture uses React with TypeScript and TailwindCSS
- State management is handled with React Context API and custom hooks
- The UI is organized into pages, layouts, and shared components
- Tauri Commands API is used for backend integration
- The directory structure is configurable with minimal, standard, and extended templates
- Git-LFS is used for binary files and large assets
- Each part has a consistent directory structure with design, manufacturing, documentation, and tests
- The library structure supports multiple CAD tools with separate directories (kicad-library, etc.)
- Users can select which directories they need to avoid empty directories
- The development environment requires Rust, Node.js, Git with Git-LFS, and platform-specific dependencies
- Windows development requires additional components like WebView2 Runtime and C++ Build Tools
- Cross-platform development is supported with platform-specific setup instructions
- The CI/CD pipeline uses GitHub Actions for automated building, testing, and releasing
- Three workflow types are implemented: CI (for testing), Release (for production builds), and Development Builds (for previews)
- Code signing is configured for both macOS and Windows to improve security and user experience
- The project follows Semantic Versioning for version management
- The Git Backend Manager implementation uses git2-rs for Git operations and provides a high-level API
- Error handling is comprehensive with custom error types and proper propagation
- Git hooks are used to enforce PLM workflows and maintain metadata consistency
- The conflict resolution system supports different strategies for different file types

## Open Questions
- Integration approach between Git Backend Manager and Metadata Manager
- Performance considerations for SQLite with large part libraries
- Best approach for CAD integration with multiple workspaces
- Approach for handling offline scenarios in the UI
- Strategy for handling custom directory structures for specific part types
- Deployment considerations for different platforms
- Implementation approach for test fixtures and mocks
- Strategy for integration testing between frontend and backend
