## Issue Overview

The Implexa project has a dual crate structure with ongoing architectural issues:

1. **Library Crate (`lib.rs`)**: Exports core functionality, database models, and Git backend
2. **Binary Crate (`main.rs`)**: Implements the Tauri application using the library crate

The current architecture has duplicate command modules in both crates, leading to import confusion and circular dependencies:

- Binary crate (main.rs) has local command modules (`mod commands;`, `mod part_commands;`, etc.)
- Library crate (lib.rs) has its own `pub mod commands;`
- Commands in the binary crate incorrectly use `crate::` imports instead of `implexa::` imports when referring to library code

A previous attempt (DEC-020) tried to fix this by changing import paths from `crate::` to `implexa::`, but the build is still failing with errors like:
```
error[E0463]: can't find crate for `implexa`
```

This indicates a more fundamental architectural issue that requires structural changes rather than just import path fixes.

## Root Cause Analysis

The root cause of these issues is an architectural inconsistency in how the dual crate structure is organized:

1. **Duplicated Module Names**: Both `main.rs` and `lib.rs` have modules with the same names
2. **Incorrect Dependency Direction**: Command implementation is split across both crates, creating circular dependencies
3. **Import Confusion**: Using `crate::` in binary crate modules but needing functionality from the library crate

The previous fix approach focused on changing import paths but didn't address the structural issue of having duplicate command modules across both crates.

## Refactoring Approach

The correct approach is to restructure the project to ensure command implementations live entirely in the library crate, with the binary crate only responsible for registering these commands with Tauri.

### Current Structure

```
src/
├── lib.rs                 // Library crate entry point
├── main.rs                // Binary crate entry point
├── commands.rs            // Command implementations in binary crate
├── part_commands.rs       // Part command implementations in binary crate
├── relationship_commands.rs // Relationship command implementations in binary crate
└── ... (other command files)
```

### Target Structure

```
src/
├── lib.rs                 // Library crate entry point
├── main.rs                // Binary crate entry point (only registers commands)
├── commands/              // All command implementations in library crate
│   ├── mod.rs             // Re-exports all commands
│   ├── parts.rs           // Part command implementations
│   ├── repository.rs      // Repository command implementations
│   ├── relationships.rs   // Relationship command implementations
│   └── ... (other command modules)
```

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Prepare the Library Crate

1. Create a `commands` directory in the `src` folder
2. Create a `mod.rs` file in the `commands` directory to re-export all commands
3. Create individual command module files in the `commands` directory (parts.rs, repository.rs, etc.)

### 2. Move Command Implementations

For each command file in the binary crate:

1. Move the command implementation to the corresponding file in the library crate
2. Ensure all imports use appropriate paths (no `crate::` references to library functionality)
3. Re-export the commands from `commands/mod.rs`
4. Update `lib.rs` to export the commands module

### 3. Simplify the Binary Crate

1. Remove all command module declarations from `main.rs`
2. Import and register commands directly from the library in `main.rs`:
   ```rust
   use implexa::commands::parts::{get_parts, create_part, /* etc */};
   use implexa::commands::repository::{create_repository, open_repository, /* etc */};
   // Similar for other command modules
   ```

### 4. Ensure Proper State Management

1. Keep state initialization in the binary crate
2. Pass state instances to library command functions as needed

## Benefits of This Approach

This refactoring follows SOLID, KISS, YAGNI, and DRY principles:

- **Single Responsibility**: Command implementation belongs in the library crate
- **Simplicity**: Eliminates confusing circular dependencies
- **Minimal Design**: Removes unnecessary duplication
- **DRY**: Consolidates command logic in one place

## Architectural Considerations

The dual crate architecture still provides significant benefits:

1. **Separation of concerns**: Core business logic vs. application specifics
2. **Code reuse**: The library can be used by multiple applications
3. **Better testing**: The core logic can be tested independently
4. **Clear interfaces**: The binary crate only accesses the library through public interfaces

This refactoring strengthens these benefits by enforcing a clearer boundary between the crates.

## Testing Recommendations

After implementing these changes:

1. Run `cargo check` to verify there are no compilation errors
2. Run `cargo test` to ensure all tests pass
3. Test the Tauri application to ensure UI functionality works correctly
4. Check logging to ensure no runtime errors occur
