# Active Context

## Current Task
Implementing the database connection management refactoring in the Implexa PLM codebase.

## Database Connection Management Refactoring

We've implemented the comprehensive solution for the database connection management issues that were encountered during testing. The key components of this implementation are:

### 1. Issues Addressed
- Multiple mutable borrows of the same connection in test code
- Type mismatches between `&Transaction` and `&mut Connection`
- Inconsistent mutability requirements across manager structs
- Difficulty in mocking database connections for testing

### 2. Implementation Progress
- Created the `ConnectionManager` with interior mutability using `RefCell` in a new file `src/database/connection_manager.rs`
- Updated `DatabaseManager` to use the `ConnectionManager`
- Refactored the following manager structs to use the new approach:
  - `PartManager`
  - `RevisionManager`
  - `RelationshipManager`
  - `PartManagementManager`
  - `PropertyManager`
- Added transaction-specific methods for backward compatibility
- Updated tests to use the new approach
- Added support for mocking in tests

### 3. Implementation Details
- Used interior mutability with `RefCell` to manage access to the database connection
- Provided a consistent API for executing operations and managing transactions
- Added methods for executing read-only operations, mutable operations, and transactions
- Created transaction-specific methods for compatibility with existing code
- Updated all manager structs to use the `ConnectionManager` instead of direct connection references
- Refactored the `PartManagementManager` to use the `ConnectionManager` for all database operations
- Updated the test code to use the new approach

### 4. Benefits Achieved
- Eliminated multiple mutable borrow issues through interior mutability
- Provided a consistent API across all managers
- Simplified transaction management
- Improved testability with easier mocking
- Maintained type safety and composability
- Removed the need for mutable references to the connection in the `PartManagementManager`
- Improved error handling with consistent error propagation

## Next Steps
- Refactor the remaining manager structs to use the new approach (ApprovalManager, ManufacturerPartManager, FileManager, WorkflowManager, CategoryManager)
- Verify that all tests pass with the new implementation
- Update any remaining code that uses direct connection references
