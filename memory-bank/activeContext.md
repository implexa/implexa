# Active Context

## Current Task

Implementing the crate structure refactoring described in `crate-structure-refactor.md`.

## Progress

The refactoring has been successfully implemented with the following changes:

1. Created a modular structure for all command modules:
   - Created `src/commands/mod.rs` as a central module that re-exports all command submodules
   - Created individual modules for each command category (repository, parts, workspace, etc.)
   - Moved command functions to their respective modules

2. Fixed implementation details in various modules:
   - Fixed `PartManager` initialization in parts.rs to use references correctly
   - Fixed SQLite result conversion in revision.rs
   - Removed unused mutable variables

3. Updated lib.rs to export the commands module with proper structure

4. Simplified main.rs to use only essential commands for now

## Next Steps

âœ… 1. Update the Tauri command registration to properly register all commands from the library crate
2. Add the `#[tauri::command]` attribute to all command functions in the library modules

## Command Registration Fixes

We've implemented the command registration updates with the following changes:

1. Added wrapper functions in main.rs for all library commands, including:
   - Repository commands
   - Part commands
   - Workspace commands
   - Workflow commands
   - Revision commands
   - Relationship commands
   - Approval commands
   - Manufacturer Part commands
   - Property commands
   - File commands

2. Fixed several issues that were preventing proper command registration:
   - Fixed function signatures to match implementations in the library
   - Added missing property-related functions (get_part_properties, get_revision_properties, etc.)
   - Fixed bracketing errors in the invoke_handler registration
   - Ensured all wrapper functions are properly registered in tauri::generate_handler!

3. Successfully tested application startup - application now compiles and initializes correctly

## Database Initialization and Storage Fixes

Fixed an issue where the application was exiting immediately after startup due to database file creation triggering an infinite rebuild loop:

1. Modified database initialization process:
   - Application now starts with an in-memory database instead of creating files during startup
   - Added `new_in_memory()` method to ConnectionManager for temporary database creation
   - Improved database initialization logging

2. Implemented proper repository-specific database storage:
   - Database files are now stored within each Git repository's config directory
   - Database files are only created when a repository is opened or created
   - This better aligns with the architecture design document

3. Enhanced repository command functions:
   - Updated `create_repository` to create repository database in config directory
   - Updated `open_repository` to use existing database or create new one if needed
   - Added consistent logging of database file operations

These changes follow the project architecture, which specifies that database files should be stored within the Git repository structure, not in the project root directory.

## Recent Fixes

1. Fixed missing `WorkflowManager` import in part_management.rs
2. Fixed in-memory database journal mode issue in connection_manager.rs
   - In-memory SQLite databases use "MEMORY" journal mode, not "WAL"
   - Updated tests to expect "MEMORY" journal mode for in-memory databases
3. Fixed syntax error in connection_manager.rs (removed extra closing brace)
4. Cleaned up all compiler warnings throughout the codebase:
   - Added `#[allow(unused_imports)]` to main.rs to handle planned imports
   - Added `#[allow(dead_code)]` to GitBackendManager.log_operation, which is reserved for future logging
   - Fixed unused field warnings in various Git backend manager structs with `#[allow(dead_code)]`
   - Fixed unused imports in workspace.rs and workflow.rs
   - Renamed unused variables with underscore prefix (_variable_name) to indicate intentional non-use

## Notes

- The code now compiles successfully and all 35 tests are passing with no warnings in the main application code
- Some Tauri command registration adjustments may be needed for the full refactoring
- The basic structure is in place, but more work is needed to fully integrate with Tauri's command system
- Code is now cleaner and follows better Rust practices by handling unused code patterns appropriately
