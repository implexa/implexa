# Implexa: Active Context

## Current Session Focus
- Git Backend Manager implementation
- Core infrastructure development
- Rust module structure and organization
- Architectural decision-making for code organization

## Recent Activities
- Created Memory Bank structure
- Documented project overview in productContext.md
- Defined detailed Git Backend Manager architecture
- Designed comprehensive SQLite database schema
- Defined Part Management Workflow with focus on small teams
- Designed User Interface Architecture with React and TailwindCSS
- Defined standardized Directory Structure for parts and libraries
- Analyzing project requirements from projectBrief.md and implexa-prd.md
- Created comprehensive development environment setup documentation for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Created detailed CI/CD setup guide for GitHub Actions
- Created .gitignore file for the project
- Implemented Git Backend Manager in Rust with the following components:
  - Main GitBackendManager with configuration and error handling
  - Repository Manager for repository initialization and configuration
  - Operation Handler for Git operations (commit, branch, merge, tag)
  - LFS Manager for Git-LFS operations
  - Hook Manager for Git hooks and workflow automation
  - Conflict Resolver for handling merge conflicts
  - Auth Provider for Git authentication and credentials
- Made architectural decision to switch from mod.rs pattern to filename-as-module pattern for Rust code organization
- Created detailed Rust module refactoring guide to implement the module pattern change
- Completed refactoring of Git Backend Rust modules from mod.rs pattern to filename-as-module pattern:
  - Moved src/git_backend/mod.rs to src/git_backend.rs
  - Moved src/git_backend/auth/mod.rs to src/git_backend/auth.rs
  - Moved src/git_backend/conflict/mod.rs to src/git_backend/conflict.rs
  - Moved src/git_backend/hook/mod.rs to src/git_backend/hook.rs
  - Moved src/git_backend/lfs/mod.rs to src/git_backend/lfs.rs
  - Moved src/git_backend/operation/mod.rs to src/git_backend/operation.rs
  - Moved src/git_backend/repository/mod.rs to src/git_backend/repository.rs
  - Updated Cargo.toml to add tempfile as a dev-dependency for tests
  - Verified all tests pass with the new module structure
- Established comprehensive coding standards for Rust, TypeScript/JavaScript, and CSS

## Current Phase
Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure): Git backend, metadata storage, basic UI

## Key Insights
- The project uses Tauri and Rust for better performance and security compared to Electron
- KiCad integration is a priority for the initial CAD tool support
- Git-based version control is a core differentiator from other PLM/PDM solutions
- The part numbering system uses a category-subcategory-sequential approach
- The Git Backend Manager needs a modular design with clear interfaces for testability
- Git-LFS is essential for handling binary files and large assets in hardware design
- The database schema needs to support flexible metadata through key-value properties
- Workflow states and transitions need to be configurable in the database
- Integration between Git commits and database revisions is critical for traceability
- The Part Management Workflow should be simple and similar to Git MRs/PRs
- Multiple parts in draft state need to be supported with separate workspaces
- The system is designed for small teams (1-2 people) with simple role-based permissions
- The UI architecture uses React with TypeScript and TailwindCSS
- State management is handled with React Context API and custom hooks
- The UI is organized into pages, layouts, and shared components
- Tauri Commands API is used for backend integration
- The directory structure is configurable with minimal, standard, and extended templates
- Git-LFS is used for binary files and large assets
- Each part has a consistent directory structure with design, manufacturing, documentation, and tests
- The library structure supports multiple CAD tools with separate directories (kicad-library, etc.)
- Users can select which directories they need to avoid empty directories
- The development environment requires Rust, Node.js, Git with Git-LFS, and platform-specific dependencies
- Windows development requires additional components like WebView2 Runtime and C++ Build Tools
- Cross-platform development is supported with platform-specific setup instructions
- The CI/CD pipeline uses GitHub Actions for automated building, testing, and releasing
- Three workflow types are implemented: CI (for testing), Release (for production builds), and Development Builds (for previews)
- Code signing is configured for both macOS and Windows to improve security and user experience
- The project follows Semantic Versioning for version management
- The Git Backend Manager implementation uses git2-rs for Git operations and provides a high-level API
- Error handling is comprehensive with custom error types and proper propagation
- Git hooks are used to enforce PLM workflows and maintain metadata consistency
- The conflict resolution system supports different strategies for different file types

## Open Questions
- Integration approach between Git Backend Manager and Metadata Manager
- Performance considerations for SQLite with large part libraries
- Best approach for CAD integration with multiple workspaces
- Approach for handling offline scenarios in the UI
- Strategy for handling custom directory structures for specific part types
- Testing strategy for Git operations and error handling
- Deployment considerations for different platforms
