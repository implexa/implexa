# Active Context

## Current Task
Fixing error handling issues in the Implexa PLM codebase.

## Error Handling Refactoring Progress

### 1. Issues Addressed
- Identified and resolved issues with error type conversion between different error types
- Fixed issues with multiple mutable borrows in the ConnectionManager
- Resolved type mismatches between `&Transaction` and `&mut Connection`
- Addressed inconsistent mutability requirements across manager structs

### 2. Implementation Progress
- Modified the `ConnectionManager` to use generic error types instead of hardcoded `rusqlite::Error`
- Added `DatabaseError::GitBackend` variant to allow conversion from `GitBackendError`
- Fixed lifetime issue in `git_backend.rs` with the `create_branch` method
- Updated multiple methods in `part_management.rs` to use explicit generic type parameters
- Started updating the `workflow.rs` file with explicit type annotations
- Fixed syntax and indentation issues in the code

### 3. Remaining Tasks
- Continue updating `workflow.rs` to add type annotations (lines 503, 533, 565, 588, 619, 645, 675)
- Run cargo test again to see if any other issues remain
- Fix any remaining error handling issues that might be uncovered in testing
- Clean up unused imports across the codebase

### 4. Implementation Details
- Used generic type parameters for error handling in ConnectionManager
- Modified methods to explicitly specify error types in transaction blocks
- Improved error conversion between different error types in the system
- Fixed lifetime issues in the Git backend by implementing direct methods instead of calling through handlers

### 5. Benefits Achieved
- More flexible error handling with generic error types
- Clearer error type conversion paths
- Improved type inference with explicit type annotations
- Fixed lifetime issues in Git backend operations
