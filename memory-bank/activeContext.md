UI Command Interface Implementation for Implexa Project - Incorporating Relationship and Revision Commands

Today, I've worked on incorporating the relationship_commands.rs and revision_commands.rs modules into the frontend to enable functionality for managing part relationships and revisions.

## UI Command Interface Implementation Progress

### 1. Issues Addressed
- Integrated relationship and revision command modules into the main.rs file
- Created frontend context providers for relationship and revision functionality
- Implemented UI components to interact with these backend commands
- Enhanced the PartDetail page to display and manage relationships and revisions

### 2. Implementation Details
- Added relationship_commands.rs and revision_commands.rs imports to main.rs
- Initialized state management for the relationship and revision components
- Registered all relationship and revision commands in the Tauri invoke_handler
- Created two new context providers:
  - RelationshipsContext.tsx - For managing part relationships (parent/child)
  - RevisionContext.tsx - For managing part revisions with different statuses
- Updated App.tsx to include these new context providers
- Enhanced PartDetail.tsx to:
  - Add a new "Revisions" tab
  - Show parent relationships (where a part is used)
  - Show child relationships (components of a part)
  - Display revision history and allow status changes
  - Enable creation of new revisions and relationships

### 3. Implementation Files Modified/Created
- Modified main.rs to register relationship and revision commands
- Created src/ui/context/RelationshipsContext.tsx
- Created src/ui/context/RevisionContext.tsx
- Modified src/ui/App.tsx to include new context providers
- Enhanced src/ui/pages/PartDetail.tsx with relationship and revision UI components

### 4. Current Status
- Successfully integrated relationship and revision commands into the frontend
- Users can now view, create, update, and delete relationships and revisions through the UI
- The UI now provides a more complete PLM experience with relationship management and revision control

## Previous Task: March 6, 2025
UI Command Interface Implementation for Implexa Project

We've worked on debugging UI errors that occur when trying to use backend functionality from the frontend. The main issue identified was that many backend modules were not properly exposed to the frontend through Tauri commands.

### 1. Issues Addressed
- Fixed "Failed to create repository: command create_repository not found" error by properly registering existing repository commands
- Created command interfaces for several backend modules that weren't exposed to the frontend
- Implemented proper state initialization in the Tauri application setup

### 2. Implementation Details
- Added Tauri command interfaces for:
  - Workflow management (workflows, states, transitions)
  - Approval handling (review, approve, reject)
  - Manufacturer part management
  - Property management
  - File management
- Updated main.rs to register all commands in the invoke_handler
- Created proper state initialization for all modules to handle dependency injection

### 3. Implementation Files Created
- workflow_commands.rs - Commands for workflow management
- approval_commands.rs - Commands for approval handling
- manufacturer_part_commands.rs - Commands for manufacturer part management
- property_commands.rs - Commands for property management
- file_commands.rs - Commands for file management

Unit Testing Fixes in Implexa Project

We successfully fixed the failing unit tests in the Implexa project, focusing on the `test_part_creation_and_workflow` test in `part_management.rs` that was failing.

## Unit Testing Fixes Progress

### 1. Issues Addressed
- Fixed `new_with_transaction` methods: Eliminated the use of unimplemented placeholder functions in database/part.rs and other modules by updating PartManagementManager to use the regular new() constructors with connection_manager instead
- Fixed Git repository initialization: Added proper initial commit creation and HEAD reference setup in the test repository
- Fixed branch naming conflicts: Updated branch naming strategy to include version numbers in branch names

### 2. Implementation Details
- Updated PartManagementManager to use standard manager constructors with connection_manager instead of transaction-based constructors
- Added Git repository initialization with proper HEAD reference to "main" branch
- Modified branch naming in create_revision to include version numbers (part/{part_number}/v{version}/draft)
- Chose to maintain separate branches for each revision to provide better audit trails and traceability

### 3. Architectural Decisions
- **Branch Management Strategy**: Decided to use separate branches for each revision rather than reusing the same branch. This provides:
  - Better audit trail - each revision has its own dedicated branch
  - Clear separation between revisions - branches are uniquely identified
  - Better traceability - easy to see which branch corresponds to which revision
  - Improved support for regulatory compliance with clear version history
  - Support for parallel work on different revisions if needed

### 4. Results
- All 30 unit tests now pass successfully
- Eliminated reliance on unimplemented placeholder methods
- Established a clear branch naming convention for different revisions

Error Handling Fixed in Implexa Project

We identified and fixed type annotation issues in several database-related files:
- Fixed workflow.rs to include explicit type annotations for return values
- Fixed file.rs to include explicit type annotations for return values
- Fixed approval.rs to include explicit type annotations for return values
- Fixed manufacturer_part.rs to include explicit type annotations for return values
- Fixed property.rs to include explicit type annotations for return values
- Fixed relationship.rs to include explicit type annotations for return values
- Fixed revision.rs to include explicit type annotations for return values
- Fixed part.rs to include explicit type annotations for return values
- Fixed a duplicate SchemaVersion insertion in schema.rs that was causing unique constraint violations

All type annotation issues have been resolved, and the code now compiles successfully. The unit tests are now able to run, revealing some foreign key constraint failures that would need to be addressed separately.

## Error Handling Refactoring Progress

### 1. Issues Addressed
- Identified and resolved issues with error type conversion between different error types
- Fixed issues with multiple mutable borrows in the ConnectionManager
- Resolved type mismatches between `&Transaction` and `&mut Connection`
- Addressed inconsistent mutability requirements across manager structs

### 2. Implementation Progress
- Modified the `ConnectionManager` to use generic error types instead of hardcoded `rusqlite::Error`
- Added `DatabaseError::GitBackend` variant to allow conversion from `GitBackendError`
- Fixed lifetime issue in `git_backend.rs` with the `create_branch` method
- Updated multiple methods in `part_management.rs` to use explicit generic type parameters
- Started updating the `workflow.rs` file with explicit type annotations
- Fixed syntax and indentation issues in the code

### 3. Implementation Details
- Used generic type parameters for error handling in ConnectionManager
- Modified methods to explicitly specify error types in transaction blocks
- Improved error conversion between different error types in the system
- Fixed lifetime issues in the Git backend by implementing direct methods instead of calling through handlers

### 4. Benefits Achieved
- More flexible error handling with generic error types
- Clearer error type conversion paths
- Improved type inference with explicit type annotations
- Fixed lifetime issues in Git backend operations
