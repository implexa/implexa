# Implexa: Git-Based PLM/PDM Solution - Project Brief

## Project Overview
Implexa is a hardware-focused Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) and Product Data Management (PDM) solution that leverages Git for version control while remaining CAD-agnostic. Built with Tauri and Rust, it bridges the gap between software engineering practices and hardware design workflows, enabling efficient management of design files across multiple CAD platforms.

## Core Problem Addressed
Current PLM/PDM solutions fall into two problematic categories:
1. Standalone systems that require manual file uploads and don't efficiently track design files
2. CAD-embedded systems that only work with their respective CAD suite

Engineers need a solution that works with raw files from any CAD tool while providing structured PLM/PDM capabilities integrated with modern Git-based workflows.

## Key Features

- **Git-Based Version Control**: Use Git for tracking all design files and metadata
- **CAD-Agnostic**: Work with multiple CAD tools, with special focus on KiCad integration
- **Unified Part Library Management**: Consistent structure for all components
- **BOM and Relationship Management**: Track relationships between parts
- **Modern, Lightweight UI**: Built with Tauri for better performance and security
- **Intelligent Part Numbering**: Enhanced hybrid schema with categories and subcategories

## Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript and TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Rust for performance and reliability
- **Application Framework**: Tauri for cross-platform support
- **Database**: SQLite for metadata storage
- **Version Control**: Git with Git-LFS for large file support

## Implementation Approach
The project is being implemented in phases:

1. **Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure)**: Git backend, metadata storage, basic UI
2. **Phase 2 (BOM Management)**: KiCad integration, relationship tracking
3. **Phase 3 (Release Management)**: Workflow automation, manufacturing outputs
4. **Phase 4 (Advanced Features)**: Visual relationship mapping, search, diff tools

## Current Status
Implementation of Phase 1 is underway, focusing on establishing the core components:
- Git backend manager for repository operations
- SQLite database schema for part information
- Part management logic for creation and tracking
- Core UI components using Tauri and React

## Next Steps
- Complete Phase 1 implementation
- Set up automated testing and CI/CD pipelines
- Begin work on KiCad integration for Phase 2
- Gather user feedback on initial release
