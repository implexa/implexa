# Implexa: Product Context

## Project Overview
Implexa is a hardware-focused Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) and Product Data Management (PDM) solution that leverages Git for version control while remaining CAD-agnostic. Built with Tauri and Rust, it bridges the gap between software engineering practices and hardware design workflows, enabling efficient management of design files across multiple CAD platforms.

## Core Problem Addressed
Current PLM/PDM solutions fall into two problematic categories:
1. Standalone systems that require manual file uploads and don't efficiently track design files
2. CAD-embedded systems that only work with their respective CAD suite

Engineers need a solution that works with raw files from any CAD tool while providing structured PLM/PDM capabilities integrated with modern Git-based workflows.

## Key Features
- **Git-Based Version Control**: Use Git for tracking all design files and metadata
- **CAD-Agnostic**: Work with multiple CAD tools, with special focus on KiCad integration
- **Unified Part Library Management**: Consistent structure for all components
- **BOM and Relationship Management**: Track relationships between parts
- **Modern, Lightweight UI**: Built with Tauri for better performance and security
- **Intelligent Part Numbering**: Enhanced hybrid schema with categories and subcategories

## Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript and TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Rust for performance and reliability
- **Application Framework**: Tauri for cross-platform support
- **Database**: SQLite for metadata storage
- **Version Control**: Git with Git-LFS for large file support

## Implementation Approach
The project is being implemented in phases:

1. **Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure)**: Git backend, metadata storage, basic UI
2. **Phase 2 (BOM Management)**: KiCad integration, relationship tracking
3. **Phase 3 (Release Management)**: Workflow automation, manufacturing outputs
4. **Phase 4 (Advanced Features)**: Visual relationship mapping, search, diff tools

## Key Components
1. **Git Backend Manager**: Manages interaction with Git repositories
2. **Metadata Manager**: Uses SQLite database to store and maintain PLM-specific metadata
3. **CAD File Parsers**: Plugins to extract information from various CAD file formats
4. **Workflow Engine**: Defines and enforces workflows for design changes, reviews, and releases
5. **Diff Tools**: Specialized visualization tools for comparing different file types
6. **Part Library Management**: Organizes parts in a unified structure
7. **User Interface**: Tauri application with React frontend

## Part Numbering Strategy
The system uses an enhanced hybrid numbering approach:
```
[Category]-[Subcategory]-[Sequential Number]
```

## Data Storage Model
Each part has a standardized directory structure:
```
/parts/
  /[Category]-[Subcategory]-[Number]/  # Part number
    design/                # Design files
    manufacturing/         # Output files
    documentation/         # Documentation
    metadata.db            # SQLite metadata
```

## Memory Bank Structure
This Memory Bank contains the following core files:
- **productContext.md**: This file - Project overview and high-level design
- **activeContext.md**: Tracks the current session's context and focus
- **progress.md**: Tracks progress and manages tasks
- **decisionLog.md**: Logs architectural decisions and their rationale

## Project Name Origin
Implexa comes from the Latin word "implex," meaning "interweaving" or "entanglement." The name reflects how the system helps manage the complex, interconnected relationships in hardware product developmentâ€”parts, assemblies, revisions, alternates, variants, and ECNs all woven together into a coherent system. As a bonus, it contains the letters P, L, and M.
