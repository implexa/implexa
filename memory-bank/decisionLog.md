## Decisions

### DEC-010 - Rust Module Organization Pattern
- **Date:** 2025-03-03
- **Status:** Implemented
- **Context:** The project currently uses the mod.rs pattern for organizing Rust modules (e.g., src/git_backend/conflict/mod.rs). There was a discussion about potentially switching to the newer filename-as-module pattern (e.g., src/git_backend/conflict.rs) while the project is still young.
- **Decision:** Switch from the mod.rs pattern to the filename-as-module pattern for all Rust modules in the project.
- **Alternatives:**
  - **mod.rs pattern (current):**
    - Each module is a directory with a mod.rs file inside it
    - Example: src/git_backend/conflict/mod.rs
  - **filename-as-module pattern (newer):**
    - Each module is a file named after the module
    - Example: src/git_backend/conflict.rs
- **Consequences:**
  - **Positive:**
    - Flatter directory structure that's easier to navigate
    - Unique filenames make navigation and tab management easier in editors
    - Aligns with current Rust community best practices and style guide recommendations
    - Makes future refactoring easier (moving and renaming modules)
    - Improves developer experience, especially for those familiar with modern Rust codebases
  - **Negative:**
    - Requires a one-time refactoring effort to rename and move files
    - Less visual indication in file explorers that a directory is a module
    - May require more explicit pub mod declarations for submodules

### DEC-001 - Use of Tauri over Electron
- **Date:** 2025-03-02 (Documented retroactively)
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** The project needed a cross-platform desktop application framework that could integrate with web technologies while providing good performance and security.
- **Decision:** Use Tauri instead of Electron for the application framework.
- **Alternatives:**
  - Electron: More widely used but has larger application size and higher memory usage
  - Qt: Powerful but steeper learning curve and less integration with web technologies
  - Native applications: Maximum performance but requires platform-specific code
- **Consequences:**
  - Positive: Smaller application size (10-20x smaller than Electron), lower memory usage, better security through Rust's memory safety, and granular permissions model
  - Negative: Smaller community and ecosystem compared to Electron, potential learning curve for Rust

### DEC-002 - Enhanced Hybrid Part Numbering Schema
- **Date:** 2025-03-02 (Documented retroactively)
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** The system needed a part numbering scheme that balances human readability with system flexibility.
- **Decision:** Implement an enhanced hybrid numbering approach combining category and subcategory codes with sequential numbers: `[Category]-[Subcategory]-[Sequential Number]`
- **Alternatives:**
  - Purely sequential numbers: Simple but not human-readable
  - Intelligent part numbers with encoded attributes: Human-readable but rigid and can become outdated
  - UUID-based identifiers: System-friendly but not human-readable
- **Consequences:**
  - Positive: Balances human readability with system flexibility, provides meaningful categorization, supports future growth
  - Negative: Requires maintenance of category and subcategory lists, potential for miscategorization
- **References:** PRD section "Part Numbering Strategy"

### DEC-003 - Memory Bank Initialization
- **Date:** 2025-03-02
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** The project needed a structured way to maintain architectural documentation, track progress, and record decisions.
- **Decision:** Initialize a Memory Bank with core files (productContext.md, activeContext.md, progress.md, decisionLog.md).
- **Alternatives:**
  - Traditional documentation in /doc directory: Less structured and harder to maintain
  - Wiki-based documentation: Requires additional infrastructure
  - No formal documentation structure: Leads to scattered and inconsistent documentation
- **Consequences:**
  - Positive: Provides a structured approach to documentation, centralizes project context, facilitates knowledge sharing
  - Negative: Requires discipline to maintain and update

- **Decision:** Implement a modular architecture with six subcomponents (Repository Manager, Operation Handler, LFS Manager, Hook Manager, Conflict Resolver, Auth Provider) and clearly defined interfaces.
- **Alternatives:**
  - Monolithic design: Simpler but less maintainable and testable
  - Thin wrapper around git2-rs: Less abstraction but more direct access to Git functionality
  - Process-based approach (shell out to git CLI): More familiar to developers but less performant and secure
- **Consequences:**
  - Positive: Clear separation of concerns, improved testability, better error handling, and more maintainable code
  - Positive: Abstractions that align with PLM concepts rather than raw Git operations
  - Positive: Strong typing and comprehensive error handling through Rust's type system

### DEC-005 - SQLite Database Schema Design
- **Date:** 2025-03-02
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** The project needed a database schema to store metadata for parts, relationships, and properties. The schema needed to be flexible enough to support various types of metadata while maintaining data integrity.
- **Decision:** Implement a comprehensive SQLite database schema with tables for Parts, Revisions, Relationships, Properties, Manufacturer Parts, Approvals, Files, Workflows, Workflow States, and Workflow Transitions.
- **Alternatives:**
  - NoSQL database: More flexible but less structured and potentially less reliable for relational data
  - File-based metadata: Simpler but less powerful for querying and maintaining relationships
  - Embedded metadata in Git: More integrated with version control but limited query capabilities
  - PostgreSQL or other client-server database: More powerful but adds deployment complexity
- **Consequences:**
  - Positive: Strong data integrity through foreign key constraints and transactions
  - Positive: Flexible metadata through key-value properties with typed values
  - Positive: Support for complex workflows through configurable states and transitions
  - Positive: Integration with Git through commit hash references
  - Positive: SQLite's embedded nature aligns well with Tauri's architecture
