## Overview

This document details the issue, solution, and implementation for fixing a critical startup problem in the Implexa application related to database initialization and storage location.

## Issue Description

The Tauri application was exiting immediately after startup (within 0.5 seconds). Investigation revealed that SQLite database files were being created in the project root directory during application startup. These file changes were triggering Tauri's file watcher, causing a continuous rebuild loop:

1. Application starts
2. Database files (implexa.db, implexa.db-shm, implexa.db-wal) created in project root
3. Tauri file watcher detects changes
4. Application rebuilds, starting the cycle again

This issue appeared after code cleanup to remove compiler warnings, suggesting that the improper database initialization had been masked by other issues previously.

## Solution Approach

The solution implements proper database initialization and storage aligned with the project's architecture:

1. **Start with an in-memory database during startup:**
   - Application initialization uses a temporary in-memory SQLite database
   - No files are created during application startup, avoiding the rebuild loop
   - Added `new_in_memory()` method to ConnectionManager

2. **Repository-specific database storage:**
   - Each Git repository gets its own database stored in its config directory
   - This aligns with the architecture design document which specifies that database files should live within repositories
   - Database files are only created when a repository is opened or created

3. **Implementation improvements:**
   - Better logging of database operations
   - Fixed compiler warnings related to unused variables
   - More robust error handling for database operations

## Implementation Details

### Code Changes

1. **ConnectionManager enhancements:**
   - Added `new_in_memory()` method to create a temporary in-memory database
   - Updated documentation to clarify different initialization approaches
   - Added appropriate logging during database initialization

2. **Database initialization:**
   - Modified `init_database_state()` to use in-memory database during startup
   - Improved logging to show database type and location

3. **Repository command updates:**
   - Updated `create_repository` to create repository database in the config directory
   - Updated `open_repository` to use existing database or create new one if needed
   - Added checks for existing database files
   - Added improved logging for database file operations

4. **Code quality improvements:**
   - Fixed compiler warnings about unused variables with underscore prefixes
   - Improved error handling and messages

### Files Affected

- `src/commands/parts.rs` - Modified database initialization to use in-memory database
- `src/database/connection_manager.rs` - Added in-memory database support
- `src/commands/repository.rs` - Added repository-specific database handling
- `src/main.rs` - Updated command wrappers to include database state parameter

## Benefits

1. **Stability:** Eliminated the Tauri rebuild loop causing the application to exit immediately
2. **Architecture alignment:** Database files now stored within repositories as per design
3. **Performance:** Improved startup performance by deferring database file creation
4. **Organization:** Better separation of concerns with repository-specific databases
5. **Flexibility:** Added in-memory database option for future use cases

## Next Steps

1. Enhance the repository database handling to fully support switching between repositories
2. Implement proper migration from in-memory to file-based databases when repositories are opened
3. Consider adding database backup and recovery options
4. Add more comprehensive logging of database operations
